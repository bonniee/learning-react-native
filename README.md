- O'Reilly: [http://bit.ly/learningreactnative](http://bit.ly/learningreactnative)

## Versions

Release 0.0.1 is the version published in the printed book (first edition). The versions of React Native used in each project vary; most use React Native `0.11.x`.

Release 1.0.0 is the next version, updated to use React Native version `0.26.3`. This version also uses more ES2015-style JavaScript idioms, when appropriate; most notably consistent ES6-style classes and module definitions. The `PlatformSpecific` project remains at version `0.0.1`, due to the example's incompatibility with React Native `0.26.3`.
