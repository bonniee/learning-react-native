# learning-react-native

Code samples for the book _Learning React Native_. You can get the book from [Amazon](http://bit.ly/lrnamaff) or [O'Reilly](http://bit.ly/learningreactnative)!

## How to use

As of [Release 2.0.0](https://github.com/bonniee/learning-react-native/releases/tag/2.0.0), full project code is _not_ included. Instead, the relevant JavaScript files for each example are provided. You'll want to create your own React Native project, either by using `create-react-native-app` or `react-native init`.

Some projects are not compatible with Expo apps (i.e. those created with `create-react-native-app`). If you are using an Expo-based app, you will need to eject in order to use those projects.

## Versions

[Release 2.0.0](https://github.com/bonniee/learning-react-native/releases/tag/2.0.0) contains code samples from the second edition of _Learning React Native_.

[Release 1.0.0](https://github.com/bonniee/learning-react-native/releases/tag/1.0.0) is the next version, updated to use React Native version `0.26.3`. This version also uses more ES2015-style JavaScript idioms, when appropriate; most notably consistent ES6-style classes and module definitions. The `PlatformSpecific` project remains at version `0.0.1`, due to the example's incompatibility with React Native `0.26.3`.

[Release 0.0.1](https://github.com/bonniee/learning-react-native/releases/tag/0.0.1) contains code samples as published in _Learning React Native_. The versions of React Native used in each project vary; most use React Native `0.11.x`.
